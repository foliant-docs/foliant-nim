# foliant

**foliant** is a documentation generator that builds PDF, Docx, and TeX
documents from Markdown source.

# Get It

- Download the compiled binary from this repo's `bin` directory and use it
  right away.

- If you have Nim and Nimble installed, install foliant with Nimble:

```shell
$ nimble install foliant
```

# Usage

```
Usage: foliant (build|upload) OPTIONS ARGUMENTS

build
-----

Build PDF, Docx, TeX, or Markdown file from Markdown source. Special target
"gdrive" is a shortcut for building Docx and uploading it to Google Drive.

Usage: foliant build --target=(pdf|docx|tex|markdown|gdrive) [--path=/project/path]

If no path is specified, the current directory is used.

You can shorten "--target"" to "-t," "--path" to "-p," and targetâ€”to a single
character:

  $ foliant -t=p -p=/project/path

Using ":" instead of "=" is allowed. Using space IS NOT:

  $ foliant -t:d -p:/project/path # OK
  $ foliant -t d -p /project/path # FAIL

upload
------

Upload Docx file to Google Drive. To use the Google Drive API, you need
a web app OAuth 2.0 client secret from Google API Console. You probably
don't have to create the app yourself. Instead, you should be provided
with a client_secret_*.json file, which you should put in foliant's
working directory or point explicitly with "--secret."

Usage: foliant upload /project/to/yourdocument.docx [--secret=/path/to/client_secret_*.json]

You can shorten "--secret"" to "-s":

  $ foliant -s=/path/to/client_secret_*.json /project/to/yourdocument.docx

Using ":" instead of "=" is allowed. Using space IS NOT:

  $ foliant -s:/path/to/client_secret_*.json /project/to/yourdocument.docx # OK
  $ foliant -s /path/to/client_secret_*.json /project/to/yourdocument.docx # FAIL
```

# Project Layout

For foliant to be able to build your docs, your project must conform
to a particular layout:

```
projectRoot/
  references/
    ref.docx
  sources/
    images/
      image1.png
      anotherImage.jpg
    chapter1.md
    chapter2.md
    introduction.md
  templates/
    basic.tex
    anotherTemplate.tex
  client_secret*.json
  config.json
  main.yaml
```
## references/

Directory with the Docx reference file. It **must** be called `ref.docx`.

## sources/

Directory with the Markdown source file of your project.

## images/

Images that can be embedded in the source files. When embedding an image,
**do not** prepend it with `images/`:

```markdown
![](image1.png)        # RIGHT
![](images/image1.png) # WRONG
```
## templates/

LaTeX templates used to build PDF, Docx, and TeX files. The exact template
to use is configured in `config.json`.

## client_secret*.json

Client secret file obtained from Google API Console. You probably don't need
to obtain it yourself. The person who told you to use foliant should provide
you this file as well. It's not stored in the GitHub repo for security reasons.

## config.json

Config file, mostly for Pandoc.

```js
{
  "title": "Lorem ipsum",           // Document title.
  "second_title": "Dolor sit amet", // Document subtitle.
  "lang": "english",                // Document language, "russian" or "english."
                                    // If not specified, "russian" is used.
  "company": "restream",            // Your company name, "undev" or "restream".
                                    // Shown at the bottom of each page.
  "year": "2016",                   // Document publication year.
                                    // Shown at the bottom of each page.
  "title_page": "true",             // Add title page or not.
  "toc": "true",                    // Add table of contents or not.
  "tof": "true",                    // Unknown
  "template": "basic",              // LaTeX template to use. Do NOT add ".tex"!
  "version": "1.0",                 // Document version. If not specified
                                    // or set to "auto," the version is generated
                                    // automatically based on git tag and revision number.
  "date":"true",                    // Add date to the title page.
  "type": "",                       // Unknown
  "alt_doc_type": "",               // Unknown
}
```

For historic reasons, all config values should be strings,
even if they *mean* a number or boolean value.

## main.yaml

Contents file. Here, you define the order of the chapters of your project:

```yaml
--- # Contents
chapters:
- introduction
- chapter1
- chapter2
...
```
